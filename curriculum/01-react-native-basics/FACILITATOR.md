## How do I prep for today?
- Do all of the pre-work.
- Install everything
- Run both demos
- Practice adding native components to the ejected app (fully manual process)
- Practice and understand the expo APIs

## What might students struggle with today? 
- Just getting it to wire up. 
- Lots of moving parts, so really go deep in the demo to explain where all of the connections lie.

## What bugs, issues, or surprises have come up in the past for this class?
